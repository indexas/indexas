# Index Network: The Web3 Discovery Protocol 

## Summary 

Web discovery tools have fallen short when it comes to connecting users with meaningful information online. Problems like ineffective filtering, lack of context, algorithmic biases towards certain monetization goals, and insufficient human curation are making it harder for people to find trusted information, and discover different perspectives and tastes.

Enter [Index Network](https://index.network/). Harnessing the power of AI and decentralization, Index Network empowers creators to build and use discovery engines by providing data ownership, interoperability, collaboration, and monetization. By enabling the composability of discovery engines, Index functions as a contextual discovery protocol for web3, establishing a decentralized information discovery ecosystem.

  
## How does Index Network work? 

Index lets users design bespoke discovery experiences, known as indexes. Rather than relying on general search engines like Google or ChatGPT to scan the entire web, each index focuses only on the specific context with the scope specified by the creator. Creators can add web pages, PDFs and documents to their indexes, which are stored on Ceramic, a decentralized data network. 

These indexes are queryable with natural language and return knowledge-augmented responses. Furthermore, Index  supports composable queries across indexes thanks to interoperability, which crafts a discovery experience that genuinely mirrors the richness, diversity, and depth of human society.

With [Ceramic Network](https://ceramic.network), index becomes a part of an interoperable data ecosystem and it allows discoverability of different data models such as attestations, events or products. Since Ceramic uses IPFS, all indexes are stored on a decentralized network. It gives users the ability to create, own, and store their own data without having to trust a third party.

Using [Lit Protocol](https://litprotocol.com)'s decentralized access control, creators can establish on-chain access criteria, which can also be linked to collaboration & creator monetization. They can set conditions such as membership in a DAO, owning a particular NFT, possessing a certain amount of ETH, or meeting any smart contract function's criteria to manage access. This enables a diverse range of new user groups —including companies, communities, curators and DAOs— to actively participate in the decentralized discovery ecosystem and ensures creators retain content access control and uphold ownership rights.


## What is an example use case? 

Meet Aria, a software developer discovers Index while exploring Ceramic Network and Lit Protocol documentation page. She checked their embedded discovery engine and starred them, then asked a composable query on Index Network about integrating the two technologies. Index Network quickly retrieves comprehensive and trusted results from both discovery engines, saving her time and connecting her with a builder community, making Index Network an essential information exploration tool for her.

**More examples abound:**
- News readers can use composable queries to navigate different viewpoints in the media, fostering a more comprehensive understanding. 
    
- Similarly, professionals can craft queries across indexes from multiple firms to analyze strategies, assess technological implications, and scrutinize industry trends.
    
- Blending product indexes with those of tastemakers, Index enables users to delve into varied style compositions while also offering a new way for tastemakers to express themselves but also introduces a new revenue channel.
