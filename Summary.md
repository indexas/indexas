### What is Index Network

Index Network is a creator tool to make composable discovery engines. As Index, we ultimately serve as the facilitator of contextual discovery in web3 by enabling a network of discovery engines. We believe enabling network relationships across discovery engines can establish a more decentralized information discovery ecosystem. This way, we can ensure that even the most trusted opinions, unique tastes, and perspectives are discoverable. 

### Why are We Building Index?

Discovery is one of the main components of decentralization, but it lacks an open and interoperable standard. As Index, we ultimately serve as the facilitator of contextual discovery in web3 by enabling a network of discovery engines.
  
To enable this, we built a tool that allows creators to create contextual discovery engines using their information, such as products, articles, documents, videos, etc. We store data in a decentralized network (ComposeDB/IPFS) to provide user ownership, and we store them in an interoperable way to enable composability. By integrating indexes with LLMs, we allow users to query across different/multiple indexes.

We provide collaboration options through NFT ownership, which allows different user groups, such as companies, communities, and DAOs, to create their own individual indexes.

Additionally, we offer access control options through NFT ownership, ensuring privacy for indexes and enabling them to serve as a method of monetization for creators.

### Our Vision

We believe enabling network relationships across discovery engines can establish a more decentralized information discovery ecosystem. This way, we can ensure that even the most trusted opinions, unique tastes and perspectives are discoverable.
