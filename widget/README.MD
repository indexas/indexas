# Quick Start

Index is a discovery protocol that eliminates the need for intermediaries in finding knowledge, products, and like-minded people through direct, composable discovery across the web. As the first decentralized semantic index, it leverages Web3 and AI and offers an open layer for discovery.

IndexNetwork UI SDK is a chat UI component specifically designed for interaction within the Index Network.

Super easy to integrate and offers a seamless experience, making it an ideal tool for:

- creators,
- communities,
- DAOs,
- brands,
- researchers, and many more

## Features

- Easy to integrate with any React application
- Real-time chat capabilities powered by modern practices
- Responsive design and built-in dark mode
- Fully customizable themes


## Installation

Get the latest package via npm.

```bash
yarn add @indexnetwork/ui
```

## Usage

Place `IndexChat` tag into your app with your sources, both did and index ids.

This code creates a button that handles all the configuration. Now you can click it to start chatting. No extra work is required. üéâ


```typescript
import IndexChat from '@indexnetwork/ui';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Your components */}
      <IndexChat sources={["index_id"]}  />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```


## Styling

IndexChat component allows you to customize the theme by overriding the defaults for any provided value. Here's an example of how you can set a custom theme:


```typescript
const customStyle = {
  darkMode: true,
  theme: {
    light: {
      primary: '#0F172A',
      secondary: '#475569',
      accent: '#BED0EC',
      background: '#FFFFFF',
      border: '#E2E8F0',
      pale: '#F8FAFC',
    },
    dark: {
      primary: '#DFEAF4',
      secondary: '#E7EEFF',
      accent: '#1256A2',
      background: '#0F172A',
      border: '#314969',
      pale: '#212C45',
    },
  }
};

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Your components */}
      <IndexChat sources={["index_id"]}  style={customStyle} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Fonts

The package uses `Inter` as the primary and `Freizeit` as the secondary font default. If you want to enable them, add the following line to your app.

```typescript
import '@indexnetwork/ui/dist/assets/style/fonts.css';
```
